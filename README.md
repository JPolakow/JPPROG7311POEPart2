# Stock Management Web Application

This repository is my submission for Part 2 of the POE for the module Programming 3A (PROG7311).

## About the application:

The instructions were to develop a prototype stock management website for an imaginary farm store.

The application could be either a website or a desktop application, I chose to do a website.

These pages are segmented into two access types, these being farmer and employee. The farmer can only login, and add products. The employee can login, add farmers and view products.

There is a local database that stores all the data for the application. The application interacts with the database using entity framework.The database is a service based database hosted in visual studio.

## Application Framework:

This application is a ASP.NET web application (.NET Framework 4.8) developed using Visual Studio 2022.
